Javascript learning project

I have decided to learn programming with Javascript. This project is home of my studies and I will store my code examples here in GitHub. Second goal is to learn to use GitHub so that's why I chose to use GitHub as home to my codes.

I will do some mini projects like 2D breakout game to learn different aspects of JavaScript in a fun way.

# 2D breakout game 
1. created index.html where I study to use canvas element and draw to it with JavaScript

2. I learned how to move the ball in canvas. In this lesson I created move-tha-ball.html
