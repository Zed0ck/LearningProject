Javascript learning project

I have decided to learn programming with Javascript. This project is home of my studies and I will store my code examples here in GitHub. Second goal is to learn to use GitHub so that's why I chose to use GitHub as home to my codes.

I will do some mini projects like 2D breakout game to learn different aspects of JavaScript in a fun way.
