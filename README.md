Javascript learning project

I have decided to learn programming with Javascript. This project is home of my studies and I will store my code examples here in GitHub. Second goal is to learn to use GitHub so that's why I chose to use GitHub as home to my codes.

I will do some mini projects like 2D breakout game to learn different aspects of JavaScript in a fun way.

# 2D breakout game 
First created index.html where I study to use canvas element and draw to it with JavaScript

Second I learned how to move the ball in canvas. In this lesson I created move-tha-ball.html

Third lesson was to bounce the ball from walls. Created bounce-off-the-wall.html

Fouth file was paddle-and-keybord-controls.html. There I learned to use controls and move the paddle

Fifth lesson added game-over.html where I learned to close the game and reload scene

Sixth lesson added builf-the-brick-field.html. I learned to use arrays to draw brick field
